In the last year I worked with some Novoda colleagues on an open&#8209;source, improved version of the Android Download Manager. <br>
We started forking the AOSP one, but in the end we decided to write this new version from scratch.

Some features of the library:
* grouping of multiple files into a single download batch
* better API
* easy Notifications customisation
* no `ContentProviders` or `Broacasts` involved
* â€¦and many more!

You can read more about it in the blog post we wrote:
