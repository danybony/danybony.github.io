I participated the first **DevFest1 Veneto**, near Treviso, Italy, giving a talk about an introduction to *Google Assistant*.

In this talk I covered what Assistant is and how developers can extend its functionalities via custom Conversational UX.

I also mentored a codelab, available [at this url](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/your-first-action-on-google-with-webhook). The attending developers were able to create a simple Assistant Action using DialogFlow to parse the user requests and return the current Bitcoin price depending on the currency specified by the user. 

Here the slides for my talk:
