Notifications have been one of the core features in the Android UI since the first public release of the platform.

In this talk, presented at **Droidcon Turin 2018**, I illustrated the evolution of notifications in all the versions of Android, showing which aspects of the UI changed and how users gained new ways of interacting with notifications.

I presented then how developers can customize both appearance and interaction mechanisms in order to give users the best way of accessing important information and perform quick actions at a glance.

Here the slides for the talk:
