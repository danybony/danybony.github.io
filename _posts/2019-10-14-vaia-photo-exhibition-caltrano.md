In October 2018, the storm Vaia caused considerable damages to the Italian forests, especially in the northeast of Italy. The strong  wind, in just one day knocked down thousands and thousands of trees, with an estimate of about eight million cubic meters of wood.

My hometown Caltrano were hit too, even if in a minor measure, with some areas of the town mountain wood flattened by the storm.
To remember this event I decided to capture this through the different point of view of my drone. The vantage point this tool provided, allowed me to give some context to the different places where the forest had been most affected by the fury of the wind.

The resulting pictures were exposed in an exhibition in Caltrano, Italy, the 13th of October 2019.
