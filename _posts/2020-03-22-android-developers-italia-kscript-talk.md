As of the beginning of March Italy is [in full lockdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Italy_coronavirus_lockdown) in response to the growing pandemic of COVID-19 in the country, and consequently all public events are canceled for the foreseeable future. 

In this time it's even more important that people like me, who worked full-time remotely for a long time, give some help at least providing some sort of normality in this challenging period.

So together with the other fine folks on the [Android Developers Italia](https://androiddevs.it/) community, we decided to start a series of 100% remote meetups, each one with a guest speaker, an open discussion at the end and live audience questions.


I gave my talk about *Kotlin as a scripting language* last week and you can watch the talk and following discussion here:

This initiative proved a great success already and we have dozens of more talks planned already for the next weeks!
