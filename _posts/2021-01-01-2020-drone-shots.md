As 2020 finally ends and a new year starts, I took this opportunity to collect some of the best shots I did last year with my drone.

These are all from within Italy, mostly in Veneto but some also from other regions, and as you will see they cover pretty much every season I was ably to hike and fly.<br>
Enjoy!
