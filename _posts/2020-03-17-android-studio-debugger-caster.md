Android Studio debugger is a powerful tool, very helpful when investigating some issue with our Android app.

There are however some incredibly useful features that most developers don't know about.

I created a video lesson on Caster.io where you will learn how to use custom Data Views to obtain the most out of Android Studio debugger, by creating custom representation for given classes in the debugger view and immediately inspect only the most relevant information of the current state of your app while debugging.

It's a free lesson, you can watch it here:
