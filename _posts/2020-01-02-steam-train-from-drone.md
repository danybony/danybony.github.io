Nowadays trains are way more efficient (and cleaner) than how they used to be a century ago, but steam ones still manage to hold a huge amount of charm.
In my region there is an [association](http://www.lacarrozzamatta.it/) of passionate people that still maintains a 100-years-old steam engine and runs it a couple of times a year.

I never managed to see it in real life, until a few weeks ago, when I got to film it in a winter, snowy morning while it was running through a valley in the Alps. Here it is a video I shot with my drone and a few pictures from the day.
