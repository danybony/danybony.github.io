I am passionate about technology, I work as an Android developer for [Novoda](https://www.novoda.com) and I am a [Google Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/experts/people/daniele-bonaldo).

I studied Computer Science at University of Padua, Italy where I graduated in 2011. The final project for my MSc was focused on Mobile Ad-hoc networks and was published and presented at [2011 IFIP Wireless Days](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6098142).

Before joining Novoda I worked at iâ€™m Spa, an Italian startup where I had the chance to play with the Android platform while developing one of the first smartwatches on the market.

I am an active member of the Android community, contributing with blogposts, online video courses, conferences speaking and meet-ups worldwide. You can find my talks on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/danybony/). 
Being so active allowed me to become a [Google Developers Expert](https://developers.google.com/experts/people/daniele-bonaldo) with specializations in Android, IoT and Wearables.

While I'm not programming or building some IoT device, I love to travel and narrate the world through the eye of my camera.
